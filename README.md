SnapNotes
SnapNotes is a full stack note taking MERN application.

The goal of this project is to learn valuable skills that will allow me to get closer to the point at which i can create industry grade full stack applications. As of current, i have created simple full stack applications with React. These applications use no client-side or server-side state management, are between 1-3 pages, lack sophistication, and certainly could not be deployed for the world to use.

Inevitably, i want to be able to create real end to end projects that are performant, scalable and can actually better the world in some way. This means defining the project/product features, designing the UI/UX as well as progamming the frontend & backend. This project is designed to help me get there :)
